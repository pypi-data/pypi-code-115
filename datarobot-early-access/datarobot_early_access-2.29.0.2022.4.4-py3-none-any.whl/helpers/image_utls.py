    Image options class. Class holds image options related to image resizing and image reformatting.

    should_resize: bool
        Whether input image should be resized to new dimensions.
    image_size: Tuple[int, int]
        New image size (width, height). When both values (width, height) are specified and have
        positive values, than image resize operation will resize image to explicitly specified
        image format. This resize operation does not preserve image aspect ratio. If user would
        like to preserve image aspect ratio of original image than dimensions should be passed
        with only one dimension specified.
        For example:
          - value (200,) or (200,-1) will preserve aspect ratio and will resize to width=200
          - value (,200) or (-1,200) will preserve aspect ratio and will resize to height=200

        by DataRobot. If no format is specified by passing `None` value original image format
        will be preserved.
