Provides an excellent environment for reproducibility and team development.**\n\n\nHere are some non-goal / downside of the gokart.\n- Batch execution in parallel is supported, but parallel and concurrent execution of task in memory.\n- Gokart is focused on reproducibility. So, I/O and capacity of data storage can become a bottleneck.\n- No support for task visualize.\n- Gokart is not an experiment management tool. The management of the execution result is cut out as [Thunderbolt](https://github.com/m3dev/thunderbolt).\n- Gokart does not recommend writing pipelines in toml, yaml, json, and more. Gokart is preferring to write them in Python.\n\n# Getting Started\n\nWithin the activated Python environment, use the following command to install gokart.\n\n```\npip install gokart\n```\n\n\n# Quickstart\n\nA minimal gokart tasks looks something like this:\n\n\n```python\nimport gokart\n\nclass Example(gokart.TaskOnKart):\n    def run(self):\n        self.dump(\'Hello, world!\')\n\ntask = Example()\noutput = gokart.build(task)\nprint(output)\n```\n\n`gokart.build` return the result of dump by `gokart.TaskOnKart`. The example will output the following.\n\n\n```\nHello, world!\n```\n\n\nThis is an introduction to some of the gokart.\nThere are still more useful features.\n\nPlease See [Documentation](https://gokart.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) .\n\nHave a good gokart life.\n\n# Achievements\n\nGokart is a proven product.\n\n- It\'s actually been used by [m3.inc](https://corporate.m3.com/en) for over 3 years\n- Natural Language Processing Competition by [Nishika.inc](https://nishika.com) 2nd prize : [Solution Repository](https://github.com/vaaaaanquish/nishika_akutagawa_2nd_prize)\n\n\n# Thanks\n\ngokart is a wrapper for luigi. Thanks to luigi and dependent projects!\n\n- [luigi](https://github.com/spotify/luigi)\n',
