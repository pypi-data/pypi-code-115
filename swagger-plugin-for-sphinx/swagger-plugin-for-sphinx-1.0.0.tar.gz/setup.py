    'long_description': '[![REUSE status](https://api.reuse.software/badge/github.com/SAP/swagger-plugin-for-sphinx)](https://api.reuse.software/info/github.com/SAP/swagger-plugin-for-sphinx)\n\n# Swagger Plugin for Sphinx\n\nThis is handy plugin to bring [Swagger](https://swagger.io/) and [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/) together.\n\nIt is able to generate one or multiple swagger HTML pages with a custom configuration which host an OpenAPI specification.\n\n## Install\n\nJust run `pip install swagger-plugin-for-sphinx`\n\n\n## Usage\n\nFirst, add the plugin to the extensions list:\n```python\nextensions = ["swagger_plugin_for_sphinx.plugin"]\n```\n\nThen add the main configuration for swagger:\n```python\nswagger_present_uri = ""\nswagger_bundle_uri = ""\nswagger_css_uri = ""\n```\nThese correspond to the modules explained [here](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui/blob/master/docs/usage/installation.md).\nBy default the latest release is used from [here](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/swagger-ui-dist@latest).\n\nAs a last step, define the swagger configuration as followed:\n```python\nswagger = [\n    {\n        "name": "Service API",\n        "page": "openapi",\n        "options": {\n            "url": "openapi.yaml",\n        },\n    }\n]\n```\nEach item of the list will generate a new swagger HTML page.\nThe `name` is the HTML page name and `page` defines the file name without an extension. This needs to be included in the TOC.\nThe `options` are then used for the `SwaggerUIBundle` as defined [here](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui/blob/master/docs/usage/configuration.md).\nPlease don\'t specify the `dom_id` since it\'s hardcoded in the HTML page.\n\nIn the sphinx build, a HTML page is created and put into the `_static` directory of the build.\n\nIf the specification is provided as a file, don\'t forget to copy it (e.g. by putting it into the `html_static_path`).\n\nTo silence the warning `toctree contains reference to nonexisting document`,, just put a dummy file with the same name as `page` into the source folder.\n\n## Build and Publish\n\nThis project uses `poetry` as the dependency management and build tool.\nTo publish a new release, follow these steps:\n* Update the version in the `pyproject.toml`\n* Add an entry in the changelog\n* Push a new tag like `vX.X.X` to trigger the release\n\n## Support, Feedback, Contributing\n\nThis project is open to feature requests/suggestions, bug reports etc. via [GitHub issues](https://github.com/SAP/<your-project>/issues).
