## Configure Spot Event Plugin

![architecture diagram](../../docs/diagrams/deadline/ConfigureSpotEventPlugin.svg)

The [Spot Event Plugin](https://docs.thinkboxsoftware.com/products/deadline/10.1/1_User%20Manual/manual/event-spot.html) can scale cloud-based EC2 Spot instances dynamically based on the queued Jobs and Tasks in the Deadline Database. It associates a Spot Fleet Request with named Deadline Worker Groups, allowing multiple Spot Fleets with different hardware and software specifications to be launched for different types of Jobs based on their Group assignment.

The `ConfigureSpotEventPlugin` construct has two main responsibilities:

* Construct a [Spot Fleet Request](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/spot-fleet-requests.html) configuration from the list of [Spot Event Plugin Fleets](#spot-event-plugin-fleet).
* Modify and save the options of the Spot Event Plugin itself. See [Deadline Documentation](https://docs.thinkboxsoftware.com/products/deadline/10.1/1_User%20Manual/manual/event-spot.html#event-plugin-configuration-options).

---


**Note:** This construct will configure the Spot Event Plugin, but the Spot Fleet Requests will not be created unless you:

* Submit the job with the assigned Deadline Group and Deadline Pool. See [Deadline Documentation](https://docs.thinkboxsoftware.com/products/deadline/10.1/1_User%20Manual/manual/job-submitting.html#submitting-jobs).

---
---


***Note:** Disable 'Allow Workers to Perform House Cleaning If Pulse is not Running' in the 'Configure Repository Options' when using Spot Event Plugin. See [Deadline Documentation](https://docs.thinkboxsoftware.com/products/deadline/10.1/1_User%20Manual/manual/event-spot.html#prerequisites).*

---
---


***Note:** Any resources created by the Spot Event Plugin will not be deleted with `cdk destroy`. Make sure that all such resources (e.g. Spot Fleet Request or Fleet Instances) are cleaned up, before destroying the stacks. Disable the Spot Event Plugin by setting 'state' property to 'SpotEventPluginState.DISABLED' or via Deadline Monitor, ensure you shutdown all Pulse instances and then terminate any Spot Fleet Requests in the AWS EC2 Instance Console.*

---


### Saving Spot Event Plugin Options

To set the Spot Event Plugin options use `configuration` property of the `ConfigureSpotEventPlugin` construct:

```python
# Example automatically generated from non-compiling source. May contain errors.
const vpc = new Vpc(/* ... */);
const renderQueue = new RenderQueue(stack, 'RenderQueue', /* ... */);

const spotEventPluginConfig = new ConfigureSpotEventPlugin(stack, 'ConfigureSpotEventPlugin', {
  vpc,
  renderQueue: renderQueue,
  configuration: {
    enableResourceTracker: true,
  },
});
```

This property is optional, so if you don't provide it, the default Spot Event Plugin Options will be used.

### Saving Spot Fleet Request Configurations

Use the `spotFleets` property to construct the Spot Fleet Request Configurations from a given [Spot Event Plugin Fleet](#spot-event-plugin-fleet):

```python
# Example automatically generated from non-compiling source. May contain errors.
const fleet = new SpotEventPluginFleet(stack, 'SpotEventPluginFleet', /* ... */);

const spotEventPluginConfig = new ConfigureSpotEventPlugin(this, 'ConfigureSpotEventPlugin', {
  vpc,
  renderQueue: renderQueue,
  spotFleets: [
    fleet,
  ],
});
```

### Spot Event Plugin Fleet Subnet Placement

We highly recommend creating dedicated subnets for the Spot Event Plugin Fleets in your farm as it is considered best practice and is especially important if you are using
Deadline Secrets Management (see [Deadline Secrets Management Considerations](#using-dedicated-subnets-for-deadline-components)).

The following example creates a dedicated subnet group for a `SpotEventPluginFleet`:

```python
# Example automatically generated from non-compiling source. May contain errors.
const vpc = new Vpc(this, 'Vpc', {
  // ...
  subnetConfiguration: [
    // ...

    // Provide a subnet configuration for the SpotEventPluginFleet subnet group
    {
      name: 'SpotEventPluginFleetSubnets',
      subnetType: SubnetType.PRIVATE_WITH_NAT,
      cidrMask: 20,
    },

    // ...
  ],
  // ...
});

// ...

const fleet = new SpotEventPluginFleet(stack, 'SpotEventPluginFleet', {
  // ...
  vpc,

  // Select the dedicated WorkerInstanceFleet subnets to put the worker nodes in
  vpcSubnets: {
    subnetGroupName: "SpotEventPluginFleetSubnets",
  },

  // ...
});

new ConfigureSpotEventPlugin(stack, 'ConfigureSpotEventPlugin', {
  vpc,
  spotFleets: [
    fleet,
  ],
  // ...
})
```

## Deadline Secrets Management Considerations

### Using Dedicated Subnets for Deadline Components

When Secrets Management is enabled on the `Repository` construct, RFDK will handle configuring [identity registration settings](https://docs.thinkboxsoftware.com/products/deadline/10.1/1_User%20Manual/manual/secrets-management/deadline-secrets-management.html#automatically-registering-identities-and-adding-roles)
using the subnets of the RFDK constructs involved. Because a construct's resources can be assigned any IP address in the subnet range, RFDK must create rules that cover the entire subnet.
These identity registration settings work like an IP-address-based allowlist that give machines with IP addresses that match a rule access to secrets in Deadline, based on their [assigned role](https://docs.thinkboxsoftware.com/products/deadline/10.1/1_User%20Manual/manual/secrets-management/deadline-secrets-management.html#assigned-roles).
The components that need identity registration settings created for them include, but are not limited to, the following:

* The Application Load Balancer of the [`RenderQueue`](#render-queue)
* Deadline workers in a [`WorkerInstanceFleet`](#worker-instance-fleet)
* Deadline workers created by the Spot Event Plugin, which are configured by the [`ConfigureSpotEventPlugin`](#configure-spot-event-plugin) construct.

RFDK creates auto-registration rules based on the Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) range of the subnet(s) that a component can be deployed into. Therefore, we highly recommend
creating a dedicated subnet for each component above for the following reasons:

1. RFDK automatically configures Deadline Secrets Management [identity registration settings](https://docs.thinkboxsoftware.com/products/deadline/10.1/1_User%20Manual/manual/secrets-management/deadline-secrets-management.html#identity-management-registration-settings-ref-label).
   These settings are configured such that the Render Queue will register identities that are created by Deadline Clients (e.g. `UsageBasedLicensing`, `WorkerInstanceFleet`, and `SpotEventPluginFleet`)
   connecting via the Render Queue's Application Load Balancer (ALB). Deadline requires that you specify trusted load balancers when configuring identity registration settings by their connecting
   IP address. Application Load Balancers can scale to use any available IP address in the subnets, so the full subnet IP range is used by RFDK. For this reason, we recommend dedicating subnets
   exclusively for the Render Queue's ALB.
2. The size of the subnet can be limited to only what is necessary for your workload, avoiding an overly permissive auto-registration rule.

Please consult the [`All-In-AWS-Infrastructure-Basic` example CDK application](https://github.com/aws/aws-rfdk/blob/release/examples/deadline/All-In-AWS-Infrastructure-Basic) for a reference implementation that demonstrates dedicated subnets.

For more details on dedicated subnet placements, see:

* [Render Queue Subnet Placement](#render-queue-subnet-placement)
* [Worker Instance Fleet Subnet Placement](#worker-instance-fleet-subnet-placement)
* [Spot Event Plugin Fleet Subnet Placement](#spot-event-plugin-fleet-subnet-placement)

## Render Queue

![architecture diagram](../../docs/diagrams/deadline/RenderQueue.svg)

The `RenderQueue` is the central service of a Deadline render farm. It consists of the following components:

* **Deadline Repository** - The repository that initializes the persistent data schema used by Deadline such as job information, connected workers, rendered output files, etc.
* **Deadline Remote Connection Server (RCS)** - The central server that all Deadline applications connect to. The RCS contains the core business logic to manage the render farm.

The `RenderQueue` construct sets up the RCS and configures it to communicate with the Repository and to listen for requests using the configured protocol (HTTP or HTTPS). Docker container images are used to deploy the `RenderQueue` as a fleet of instances within an Elastic Container Service (ECS) cluster. This fleet of instances is load balanced by an [Application Load Balancer](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/application/introduction.html) which has built-in health monitoring functionality that can be configured through this construct.

The following example outlines how to construct a `RenderQueue`:

```python
# Example automatically generated from non-compiling source. May contain errors.
const version = new VersionQuery(stack, 'Version', {
  version: '1.2.3.4',
});
const images = new ThinkboxDockerImages(stack, 'Images', {
  version: version,
  // Change this to AwsThinkboxEulaAcceptance.USER_ACCEPTS_AWS_THINKBOX_EULA to accept the terms
  // of the AWS Thinkbox End User License Agreement
  userAwsThinkboxEulaAcceptance: AwsThinkboxEulaAcceptance.USER_REJECTS_AWS_THINKBOX_EULA,
});
const repository = new Repository(stack, 'Repository', { /* ...*/});

const renderQueue = new RenderQueue(stack, 'RenderQueue', {
  vpc: vpc,
  images: images,
  version: version,
  repository: repository,
});
```

### Render Queue Docker Container Images

The `RenderQueue` currently requires only one Docker container image for the Deadline Remote Connection Server (RCS).

AWS Thinkbox provides Docker recipes and images that set these up for you. These can be accessed with the `ThinkboxDockerRecipes` and `ThinkboxDockerImages` constructs (see [Staging Docker Recipes](#staging-docker-recipes) and [Thinkbox Docker Images](#thinkbox-docker-images) respectively).

If you need to customize the Docker images of your Render Queue, it is recommended that you stage the recipes and modify them as desired. Once staged to a directory, consult the `README.md` file in the root for details on how to extend the recipes.

### Render Queue Encryption

The `RenderQueue` provides end-to-end encryption of communications and data at rest. However, it currently does not do any client validation or application authentication due to limitations with Application Load Balancers that made it necessary to disable Deadline Worker TLS certificate authentication.

---


***Note:** Be extra careful when setting up security group rules that govern access to the `RenderQueue` and, for the machines that do have access to it, ensure you trust the Operating System as well as any software being used.*

---


### Render Queue Health Monitoring

The `RenderQueue` construct leverages the built-in health monitoring functionality provided by Application Load Balancers. The health check grace period and interval can be configured by specifying the `healthCheckConfig` property of the construct. For more information, see [Application Load Balancer Health Checks](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/application/target-group-health-checks.html).

### Render Queue Deletion Protection

By default, the Load Balancer in the `RenderQueue` has [deletion protection](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/application/application-load-balancers.html#deletion-protection) enabled to ensure that it does not get accidentally deleted. This also means that it cannot be automatically destroyed by CDK when you destroy your stack and must be done manually (see [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/application/application-load-balancers.html#deletion-protection)).

You can specify deletion protection with a property in the `RenderQueue`:

```python
# Example automatically generated from non-compiling source. May contain errors.
const renderQueue = new RenderQueue(stack, 'RenderQueue', {
  //...
  deletionProtection: false
});
```

### Render Queue Subnet Placement

We highly recommend creating dedicated subnets for the Render Queue's [Application Load Balancer](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/application/application-load-balancers.html)
that will only be used by the load balancer. Using dedicated subnets for load balancers is considered best practice and is especially important if you are using
Deadline Secrets Management (see [Deadline Secrets Management Considerations](#using-dedicated-subnets-for-deadline-components)).

The following example creates a dedicated subnet group for the `RenderQueue` to use for its Application Load balancer:

```python
# Example automatically generated from non-compiling source. May contain errors.
const vpc = new Vpc(this, 'Vpc', {
  // ...
  subnetConfiguration: [
    // ...

    // Provide a subnet configuration for the Render Queue subnet group
    {
      name: 'RenderQueueALBSubnets',
      subnetType: SubnetType.PRIVATE_WITH_NAT,
      cidrMask: 27,
    },

    // ...
  ],
  // ...
});

// ...

const renderQueue = new RenderQueue(stack, 'RenderQueue', {
  // ...
  vpc,

  // Select the dedicated Render Queue subnets to put the ALB in
  vpcSubnetsAlb: vpc.selectSubnets({ subnetGroupName: 'RenderQueueALBSubnets' }),

  // ...
});
```

Application Load Balancers have requirements for the subnets they are deployed into, such as requiring that each subnet be from a different Availability Zone and that each subnet
have a CIDR block with at least a `/27` bitmask and at least 8 free IP addresses per subnet. For the full list of requirements, please see the
[Elastic Load Balancing documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/application/application-load-balancers.html#subnets-load-balancer).

### Configuring Deadline Secrets Management on the Render Queue

When [Deadline Secrets Management](https://docs.thinkboxsoftware.com/products/deadline/10.1/1_User%20Manual/manual/secrets-management/deadline-secrets-management.html) is enabled on the `Repository` construct,
the `RenderQueue` will automatically configure itself as a [Server role](https://docs.thinkboxsoftware.com/products/deadline/10.1/1_User%20Manual/manual/secrets-management/deadline-secrets-management.html#assigned-roles) in Deadline Secrets Management.

For more information on using Deadline Secrets Management in RFDK, please see the [RFDK Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/rfdk/latest/guide/deadline-secrets-management-rfdk.html).

## Repository

![architecture diagram](../../docs/diagrams/deadline/Repository.svg)

The `Repository` contains the central database and file system used by Deadline. An EC2 instance is temporarily created to run the Deadline Repository installer which configures the database and file system. This construct has optional parameters for the database and file system to use, giving you the option to either provide your own resources or to have the construct create its own. Log messages emitted by the construct are forwarded to CloudWatch via a CloudWatch agent.

You can create a `Repository` like this:

```python
# Example automatically generated from non-compiling source. May contain errors.
const repository = new Repository(stack, 'Repository', {
  vpc: props.vpc,
  version: new VersionQuery(stack, 'Version', {
    version: '1.2.3.4',
  }),
});
```

### Configuring Deadline Client Connections

Deadline Clients can be configured to connect directly to the `Repository`, which will:

* Allow ingress traffic to database & file system Security Groups
* Create IAM Permissions for database & file system
* Mount the Repository file system via [UserData](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/user-data.html)

Deadline Clients can be configured either in ECS or EC2.

#### 1. Configure Deadline Client in ECS

An ECS Container Instance and Task Definition for deploying Deadline Client can be configured to directly connect to the `Repository`. A mapping of environment variables and ECS [`MountPoint`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/latest/docs/@aws-cdk_aws-ecs.MountPoint.html)s are produced which can be used to configure a [`ContainerDefinition`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/latest/docs/@aws-cdk_aws-ecs.ContainerDefinition.html) to connect to the `Repository`.

The example below demonstrates configuration of Deadline Client in ECS:

```python
# Example automatically generated from non-compiling source. May contain errors.
const taskDefinition = new Ec2TaskDefinition(stack, 'TaskDefinition');
const ecsConnection = repository.configureClientECS({
      containerInstances: /* ... */,
      containers: {
        taskDefinition
      },
    });

const containerDefinition = taskDefinition.addContainer('ContainerDefinition', {
  image: /* ... */,
  environment: ecsConnection.containerEnvironment
});
containerDefinition.addMountPoints(ecsConnection.readWriteMountPoint);
```

#### 2. Configure Deadline Client on EC2

An EC2 instance running Deadline Client can be configured to directly connect to the `Repository`.

The example below demonstrates configuration of Deadline Client in an EC2 instance:

```python
# Example automatically generated from non-compiling source. May contain errors.
const instance = new Instance(stack, 'Instance', {
  vpc,
  instanceType: new InstanceType(/* ... */),
  machineImage: MachineImage.latestAmazonLinux()
});
repository.configureClientInstance({
  host: instance,
  mountPoint: '/mnt/repository'
});
```

### Configuring Deadline Secrets Management on the Repository

When using Deadline 10.1.19 or higher, RFDK enables [Deadline Secrets Management](https://docs.thinkboxsoftware.com/products/deadline/10.1/1_User%20Manual/manual/secrets-management/deadline-secrets-management.html) on the `Repository` by default. To perform administrator functions for Deadline Secrets Management, credentials need to be created. You can either create your own in an AWS Secrets Manager Secret and have it imported into your RFDK app, or have RFDK generate the credentials and create the Secret for you.

When RFDK generates the administrator credentials, it sets the Secret's removal policy to `RETAIN` so that you will not lose them if you destroy the CloudFormation Stack that they are in. If you do want to delete this Secret, you will have to destroy it manually or change the `credentialsRemovalPolicy` to `DESTROY`. If you destroy the Stack that contains your Secret and its policy set to `RETAIN`, your existing Secret will be orphaned from your RFDK application and re-deploying the Stack will generate a new one. To help prevent orphaning a Secret that contains administrator credentials that are still in use, RFDK places it in the Stack that contains your database, so that their lifecycles are in sync.

If your database is imported into your RFDK app rather than being generated by it, RFDK will not generate credentials during deployment. You must create your own Secret with the credentials you'd like to use and [import it](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/latest/docs/aws-secretsmanager-readme.html#importing-secrets).

If you would like to use your own credentials for Deadline Secrets Management, you can do so by storing them in AWS Secrets Manager and providing them to the `Repository` construct. The Secret must be a JSON document with the following format:

```jsonc
{
  // Replace the values of these fields with your own values
  "username": "your_username",
  "password": "your_password"
}
```

---


***Note:** The `password` should be at least 8 characters long and contain at least one lowercase letter, one uppercase letter, one symbol and one number.*

---


You can then provide the ARN of the Secret containing your credentials to the `Repository` construct:

```python
# Example automatically generated from non-compiling source. May contain errors.
const secretsManagementCredentials = Secret.fromSecretCompleteArn(
  this,
  'DeadlineSecretsManagementCredentials',
  // Replace with your Secret ARN
  'yourSecretArn',
);

const repository = new Repository(this, 'Repository', {
  vpc,
  version,
  secretsManagementSettings: {
    enabled: true,
    credentials: secretsManagementCredentials,
  },
});
```

For further details, please consult the RFDK developer guide topic on [using Deadline Secrets Management in RFDK](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/rfdk/latest/guide/deadline-secrets-management-rfdk.html#using-deadline-secrets-management-in-rfdk). Please note that there is a specific process for [rotating your administrator credentials](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/rfdk/latest/guide/deadline-secrets-management-rfdk.html#rotating-deadline-secrets-management-administrator-credentials).

**WARNING:** Once the repository has been deployed and the administrator credentials are configured, changing the credential values in the Secret and re-deploying your RFDK app will not update the credentials in the Deadline Repository. You must first change the credentials in the Deadline Repository using the instructions linked above. Doing this incorrectly may cause the RFDK Render Queue to stop functioning. If you have done this and cannot recover the previous credentials, you will need to follow instructions for [forgotten Deadline Secrets Management administrator credentials](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/rfdk/latest/guide/deadline-secrets-management-rfdk.html#forgotten-deadline-secrets-management-administrator-credentials).

## Spot Event Plugin Fleet

![architecture diagram](../../docs/diagrams/deadline/SpotEventPluginFleet.svg)

This construct represents a Spot Fleet launched by the [Deadline's Spot Event Plugin](https://docs.thinkboxsoftware.com/products/deadline/10.1/1_User%20Manual/manual/event-spot.html) from the [Spot Fleet Request Configuration](https://docs.thinkboxsoftware.com/products/deadline/10.1/1_User%20Manual/manual/event-spot.html#spot-fleet-request-configurations). The construct itself doesn't create a Spot Fleet Request, but creates all the required resources to be used in the Spot Fleet Request Configuration.

This construct is expected to be used as an input to the [ConfigureSpotEventPlugin](#configure-spot-event-plugin) construct. `ConfigureSpotEventPlugin` construct will generate a Spot Fleet Request Configuration from each provided `SpotEventPluginFleet` and will set these configurations to the Spot Event Plugin.

```python
# Example automatically generated from non-compiling source. May contain errors.
const vpc = new Vpc(/* ... */);
const renderQueue = new RenderQueue(stack, 'RenderQueue', /* ... */);

const fleet = new SpotEventPluginFleet(this, 'SpotEventPluginFleet', {
  vpc,
  renderQueue,
  deadlineGroups: [
    'group_name1',
    'group_name2',
  ],
  instanceTypes: [InstanceType.of(InstanceClass.T3, InstanceSize.LARGE)],
  workerMachineImage: new GenericLinuxImage(/* ... */),
  maxCapacity: 1,
});
```

### Changing Default Options

Here are a few examples of how you set some additional properties of the `SpotEventPluginFleet`:

#### Setting Allocation Strategy

Use `allocationStrategy` property to change the default allocation strategy of the Spot Fleet Request:

```python
# Example automatically generated from non-compiling source. May contain errors.
const fleet = new SpotEventPluginFleet(this, 'SpotEventPluginFleet', {
  vpc,
  renderQueue,
  deadlineGroups: [
    'group_name',
  ],
  instanceTypes: [InstanceType.of(InstanceClass.T3, InstanceSize.LARGE)],
  workerMachineImage: new GenericLinuxImage(/* ... */),
  maxCapacity: 1,
  allocationStrategy: SpotFleetAllocationStrategy.CAPACITY_OPTIMIZED,
});
```

#### Adding Deadline Pools

You can add the Workers to Deadline's Pools providing a list of pools as following:

```python
# Example automatically generated from non-compiling source. May contain errors.
const fleet = new SpotEventPluginFleet(this, 'SpotEventPluginFleet', {
  vpc,
  renderQueue,
  deadlineGroups: [
    'group_name',
  ],
  instanceTypes: [InstanceType.of(InstanceClass.T3, InstanceSize.LARGE)],
  workerMachineImage: new GenericLinuxImage(/* ... */),
  maxCapacity: 1,
  deadlinePools: [
    'pool1',
    'pool2',
  ],
});
```

#### Setting the End Date And Time

By default, the Spot Fleet Request will be valid until you cancel it.
You can set the end date and time until the Spot Fleet request is valid using `validUntil` property:

```python
# Example automatically generated from non-compiling source. May contain errors.
const fleet = new SpotEventPluginFleet(this, 'SpotEventPluginFleet', {
  vpc,
  renderQueue,
  deadlineGroups: [
    'group_name',
  ],
  instanceTypes: [InstanceType.of(InstanceClass.T3, InstanceSize.LARGE)],
  workerMachineImage: new GenericLinuxImage(/* ... */),
  maxCapacity: 1,
  validUntil: Expiration.atDate(new Date(2022, 11, 17)),
});
```

## Stage

A stage is a directory that conforms to a [conventional structure](https://github.com/aws/aws-rfdk/blob/release/packages/aws-rfdk/docs/DockerImageRecipes.md#stage-directory-convention) that RFDK requires to deploy Deadline. This directory contains the Docker image recipes that RFDK uses to build Docker images.

### Staging Docker Recipes

Docker image recipes required by various constructs in Deadline (e.g. `RenderQueue`, `UsageBasedLicensing`, etc.) must be staged to a local directory that RFDK can consume. For information on what a Docker image recipe is and how it should be organized, see [Docker Image Recipes](https://github.com/aws/aws-rfdk/blob/release/packages/aws-rfdk/docs/DockerImageRecipes.md). You can either stage your own recipes or use ones provided by AWS Thinkbox via `ThinkboxDockerRecipes`.

#### Using Thinkbox Docker Recipes

---


***Note:** The `ThinkboxDockerRecipes` class requires a [multi-stage Dockerfile](https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/multistage-build/), so your version of Docker must meet the minimum version that supports multi-stage builds (version 17.05).*

***Note:** Regardless of what language is consuming `aws-rfdk`, the Node.js package is required since the `stage-deadline` script is used by `ThinkboxDockerRecipes` when running `cdk synth` or `cdk deploy`.*

---


AWS Thinkbox provides Docker recipes for use with Deadline constructs. To stage these recipes, use the `stage-deadline` script found in the `bin/` directory (e.g. `node_modules/aws-rfdk/bin/stage-deadline` for npm). The following example shows how to stage version 10.1.7.1 of Deadline:

```
npx stage-deadline \
  --deadlineInstallerURI s3://thinkbox-installers/Deadline/10.1.7.1/Linux/DeadlineClient-10.1.7.1-linux-x64-installer.run \
  --dockerRecipesURI s3://thinkbox-installers/DeadlineDocker/10.1.7.1/DeadlineDocker-10.1.7.1.tar.gz
```

This command will download the Deadline installers and Docker recipes for Deadline version 10.1.7.1 to a local subdirectory `stage`. The Deadline versions in the URIs **must** be equal. For more information, run `stage-deadline --help`.

In your typescript code, you can then create an instance of `ThinkboxDockerRecipes` from this stage directory like this:

```python
# Example automatically generated from non-compiling source. May contain errors.
const recipes = new ThinkboxDockerRecipes(scope, 'DockerRecipes', {
  stage: Stage.fromDirectory(/* <path-to-stage-directory> */),
});
```

#### Conveniently Run stage-deadline Script

Having to memorize the path conventions used in the URIs of the arguments to the `stage-deadline` can be cumbersome and error-prone. The following recommendations provide a more convenient way to use `stage-deadline`.

**Typescript/Javascript**

We recommend adding a `script` field in your `package.json` that runs the `stage-deadline` script with pre-populated parameters to ease the burden of having to remember the path conventions used in the thinkbox-installers S3 bucket. You can also leverage the built-in support for accessing the values of fields in `package.json` using the `${npm_package_<field1_innerfield1_...>}` syntax.

```json
{
  ...
  "config": {
    "deadline_ver": "10.1.7.1",
    "stage_path": "stage"
  },
  ...
  "scripts": {
    ...
    "stage": "stage-deadline -d s3://thinkbox-installers/Deadline/${npm_package_config_deadline_ver}/Linux/DeadlineClient-${npm_package_config_deadline_ver}-linux-x64-installer.run -c s3://thinkbox-installers/DeadlineDocker/${npm_package_config_deadline_ver}/DeadlineDocker-${npm_package_config_deadline_ver}.tar.gz -o ${npm_package_config_stage_path}",
  },
  ...
}
```

With this in place, staging the Deadline Docker recipes can be done simply by running `npm run stage`.

## Thinkbox Docker Images

Thinkbox publishes Docker images for use with RFDK to a public ECR repository. The `ThinkboxDockerImages` construct
simplifies using these images.

---


***Note:** Deadline is licensed under the terms of the
[AWS Thinkbox End User License Agreement](https://www.awsthinkbox.com/end-user-license-agreement). Users of
`ThinkboxDockerImages` must explicitly signify their acceptance of the terms of the AWS Thinkbox EULA through
`userAwsThinkboxEulaAcceptance` property. By default, `userAwsThinkboxEulaAcceptance` is set to rejection.*

---


To use it, simply create one:

```python
# Example automatically generated from non-compiling source. May contain errors.
// This will provide Docker container images for the latest Deadline release
const images = new ThinkboxDockerImages(scope, 'Images', {
  // Change this to AwsThinkboxEulaAcceptance.USER_ACCEPTS_AWS_THINKBOX_EULA to accept the terms
  // of the AWS Thinkbox End User License Agreement
  userAwsThinkboxEulaAcceptance: AwsThinkboxEulaAcceptance.USER_REJECTS_AWS_THINKBOX_EULA,
});
```

If you desire a specific version of Deadline, you can supply a version with:

```python
# Example automatically generated from non-compiling source. May contain errors.
// Specify a version of Deadline
const version = new VersionQuery(scope, 'Version', {
  version: '10.1.12',
});

// This will provide Docker container images for the specified version of Deadline
const images = new ThinkboxDockerImages(scope, 'Images', {
  version: version,
  // Change this to AwsThinkboxEulaAcceptance.USER_ACCEPTS_AWS_THINKBOX_EULA to accept the terms
  // of the AWS Thinkbox End User License Agreement
  userAwsThinkboxEulaAcceptance: AwsThinkboxEulaAcceptance.USER_REJECTS_AWS_THINKBOX_EULA,
});
```

To use these images, you can use the expressive methods or provide the instance directly to downstream constructs:

```python
# Example automatically generated from non-compiling source. May contain errors.
const renderQueue = new RenderQueue(scope, 'RenderQueue', {
  images: images,
  // ...
});
const ubl = new UsageBasedLicensing(scope, 'RenderQueue', {
  images: images,
  // ...
});

// OR

const renderQueue = new RenderQueue(scope, 'RenderQueue', {
  images: images.forRenderQueue(),
  // ...
});
const ubl = new UsageBasedLicensing(scope, 'RenderQueue', {
  images: images.forUsageBasedLicensing(),
  // ...
});
```

## Usage-Based Licensing (UBL)

![architecture diagram](../../docs/diagrams/deadline/UsageBasedLicensing.svg)

Usage-Based Licensing is an on-demand licensing model (see [Deadline Documentation](https://docs.thinkboxsoftware.com/products/deadline/10.1/1_User%20Manual/manual/licensing-usage-based.html)). The RFDK supports this type of licensing with the `UsageBasedLicensing` construct. This construct contains the following components:

* **Deadline License Forwarder** - Forwards licenses to Deadline Workers that are rendering jobs.

The `UsageBasedLicensing` construct sets up the License Forwarder, configures the defined license limits, and allows communication with the Render Queue. Docker container images are used to deploy the License Forwarder as a fleet of instances within an Elastic Container Service (ECS) cluster.

---


***Note:** This construct does not currently implement the Deadline License Forwarder's Web Forwarding functionality.*

***Note:** This construct is not usable in any China region.*

---


The following example outlines how to construct `UsageBasedLicensing`:

```python
# Example automatically generated from non-compiling source. May contain errors.
const version = new VersionQuery(stack, 'Version', '1.2.3.4');
const images = new ThinkboxDockerImages(stack, 'Images', {
  version: version,
  // Change this to AwsThinkboxEulaAcceptance.USER_ACCEPTS_AWS_THINKBOX_EULA to accept the terms
  // of the AWS Thinkbox End User License Agreement
  userAwsThinkboxEulaAcceptance: AwsThinkboxEulaAcceptance.USER_REJECTS_AWS_THINKBOX_EULA,
});

const ubl = new UsageBasedLicensing(stack, 'UsageBasedLicensing', {
  vpc: vpc,
  renderQueue: renderQueue,
  images: images,
  licenses: [ UsageBasedLicense.forKrakatoa(/* ... */), /* ... */ ],
  certificateSecret: /* ... */, // This must be a binary secret (see below)
  memoryReservationMiB: /* ... */
});
```

### Usage-Based Licensing Docker Container Images

`UsageBasedLicensing` currently requires only one Docker container image for the Deadline License Forwarder.

AWS Thinkbox provides Docker recipes that sets these up for you. These can be accessed with the `ThinkboxDockerRecipes` and `ThinkboxDockerImages` constructs (see [Staging Docker Recipes](#staging-docker-recipes) and [Thinkbox Docker Images](#thinkbox-docker-images) respectively).

### Uploading Binary Secrets to SecretsManager

The `UsageBasedLicensing` construct expects a `.zip` file containing usage-based licenses stored as a binary secret in SecretsManager. The AWS web console does not provide a way to upload binary secrets to SecretsManager, but this can be done via [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/). You can use the following command to upload a binary secret:

```
aws secretsmanager create-secret --name <secret-name> --secret-binary fileb://<path-to-file>
```

## VersionQuery

The `VersionQuery` construct encapsulates a version of Deadline and the location in Amazon S3 to retrieve the installers for that version. Deadline versions follow a `<major>.<minor>.<release>.<patch>` schema (e.g. `1.2.3.4`). Various constructs in this library use `VersionQuery` to determine the version of Deadline to work with.

You can specify a Deadline version as follows:

```python
# Example automatically generated from non-compiling source. May contain errors.
const version = new VersionQuery(stack, 'Version', {
  version: '1.2.3.4',
});
```

## Worker Instance Fleet

![architecture diagram](../../docs/diagrams/deadline/WorkerInstanceFleet.svg)

A `WorkerInstanceFleet` represents a fleet of instances that are the render nodes of your render farm. These instances are created in an [`AutoScalingGroup`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/latest/docs/@aws-cdk_aws-autoscaling.AutoScalingGroup.html) with a provided AMI that should have Deadline Client installed as well as any desired render applications. Each of the instances will configure itself to connect to the specified [`RenderQueue`](#renderqueue) so that they are able to communicate with Deadline to pick up render jobs. Any logs emitted by the workers are sent to CloudWatch via a CloudWatch agent.

You can create a `WorkerInstanceFleet` like this:

```python
# Example automatically generated from non-compiling source. May contain errors.
const fleet = new WorkerInstanceFleet(stack, 'WorkerFleet', {
  vpc,
  renderQueue,
  workerMachineImage: /* ... */,
});
```

### Worker Instance Fleet Health Monitoring

The `WorkerInstanceFleet` uses Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) health checks with its `AutoScalingGroup` to ensure the fleet is operating as expected. ELB health checks have two components:

1. **EC2 Status Checks** - Amazon EC2 identifies any hardware or software issues on instances. If a status check fails for an instance, it will be replaced. For more information, see [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/monitoring-system-instance-status-check.html).
2. **Load Balancer Health Checks** - Load balancers send periodic pings to instances in the `AutoScalingGroup`. If a ping to an instance fails, the instance is considered unhealthy. For more information, see [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/as-add-elb-healthcheck.html).

EC2 status checks are great for detecting lower level issues with instances and automatically replacing them. If you also want to detect any issues with Deadline on your instances, you can do this by configuring health monitoring options on the `WorkerInstanceFleet` along with a `HealthMonitor` (see [aws-rfdk](https://github.com/aws/aws-rfdk/blob/release/packages/aws-rfdk/lib/core/README.md)). The `HealthMonitor` will ensure that your `WorkerInstanceFleet` remains healthy by checking that a minimum number of hosts are healthy for a given grace period. If the fleet is found to be unhealthy, its capacity will set to 0, meaning that all instances will be terminated. This is a precaution to save on costs in the case of a misconfigured render farm.

Below is an example of setting up health monitoring in a `WorkerInstanceFleet`.

```python
# Example automatically generated from non-compiling source. May contain errors.
const healthMonitor = new HealthMonitor(stack, 'HealthMonitor', {
  vpc,
  elbAccountLimits: /* ... */
});

const workerFleet = new WorkerInstanceFleet(stack, 'WorkerFleet', {
  vpc,
  renderQueue: /* ... */,
  workerMachineImage: /* ... */,
  healthMonitor: healthMonitor,
  healthCheckConfig: {
    interval: Duration.minutes(5)
  }
});
```

### Custom Worker Instance Startup

You have possibility to run user data scripts at various points during the Worker configuration lifecycle.

To do this, subclass `InstanceUserDataProvider` and override desired methods:

```python
# Example automatically generated from non-compiling source. May contain errors.
class UserDataProvider extends InstanceUserDataProvider {
  preCloudWatchAgent(host: IHost): void {
    host.userData.addCommands('echo preCloudWatchAgent');
  }
}
const fleet = new WorkerInstanceFleet(stack, 'WorkerFleet', {
  vpc,
  renderQueue,
  workerMachineImage: /* ... */,
  userDataProvider: new UserDataProvider(stack, 'UserDataProvider'),
});
```

### Worker Instance Fleet Subnet Placement

We highly recommend creating dedicated subnets for the Worker Instance Fleets in your farm as it is considered best practice and is especially important if you are using
Deadline Secrets Management (see [Deadline Secrets Management Considerations](#using-dedicated-subnets-for-deadline-components)).

The following example creates a dedicated subnet group for a `WorkerInstanceFleet`:

```python
# Example automatically generated from non-compiling source. May contain errors.
const vpc = new Vpc(this, 'Vpc', {
  // ...
  subnetConfiguration: [
    // ...

    // Provide a subnet configuration for the WorkerInstanceFleet subnet group
    {
      name: 'WorkerInstanceFleetSubnets',
      subnetType: SubnetType.PRIVATE_WITH_NAT,
      cidrMask: 20,
    },

    // ...
  ],
  // ...
});

// ...

const workerInstanceFleet = new WorkerInstanceFleet(stack, 'WorkerInstanceFleet', {
  // ...
  vpc,

  // Select the dedicated WorkerInstanceFleet subnets to put the worker nodes in
  vpcSubnets: {
    subnetGroupName: "WorkerInstanceFleetSubnets",
  },

  // ...
});
```

       });

       const fleet = new SpotEventPluginFleet(this, 'SpotEventPluginFleet', {
          vpc,

    To provide this functionality, this construct will create an AWS Lambda function that is granted the ability
    to connect to the render queue. This lambda is run automatically when you deploy or update the stack containing this construct.
    Logs for all AWS Lambdas are automatically recorded in Amazon CloudWatch.

    This construct will configure the Spot Event Plugin, but the Spot Fleet Requests will not be created unless you:

    - Submit the job with the assigned Deadline Group and Deadline Pool. See `Deadline Documentation <https://docs.thinkboxsoftware.com/products/deadline/10.1/1_User%20Manual/manual/job-submitting.html#submitting-jobs>`_.

    Important: Disable 'Allow Workers to Perform House Cleaning If Pulse is not Running' in the 'Configure Repository Options'
    when using Spot Event Plugin.
    See https://docs.thinkboxsoftware.com/products/deadline/10.1/1_User%20Manual/manual/event-spot.html#prerequisites

    Important: Any resources created by the Spot Event Plugin will not be deleted with 'cdk destroy'.
    Make sure that all such resources (e.g. Spot Fleet Request or Fleet Instances) are cleaned up, before destroying the stacks.
    Disable the Spot Event Plugin by setting 'state' property to 'SpotEventPluginState.DISABLED' or via Deadline Monitor,
    ensure you shutdown all Pulse instances and then terminate any Spot Fleet Requests in the AWS EC2 Instance Console.

    Note that this construct adds additional policies to the Render Queue's role
    required to run the Spot Event Plugin and launch a Resource Tracker:

    - AWSThinkboxDeadlineSpotEventPluginAdminPolicy
    - AWSThinkboxDeadlineResourceTrackerAdminPolicy
    - A policy to pass a fleet and instance role
    - A policy to create tags for spot fleet requests

    The Spot Fleet Requests that this construct configures Deadline to create will always use the latest version of the
    corresponding EC2 Launch Template that was created for them.

    architecture diagram


    Resources Deployed

    - An AWS Lambda that is used to connect to the render queue, and save Spot Event Plugin configurations.
    - A CloudFormation Custom Resource that triggers execution of the Lambda on stack deployment, update, and deletion.
    - An Amazon CloudWatch log group that records history of the AWS Lambda's execution.
    - An IAM Policy attached to Render Queue's Role.
    - EC2 Launch Templates for each Spot Event Plugin fleet.



    Security Considerations

    - The AWS Lambda that is deployed through this construct will be created from a deployment package
      that is uploaded to your CDK bootstrap bucket during deployment. You must limit write access to
      your CDK bootstrap bucket to prevent an attacker from modifying the actions performed by this Lambda.
      We strongly recommend that you either enable Amazon S3 server access logging on your CDK bootstrap bucket,
      or enable AWS CloudTrail on your account to assist in post-incident analysis of compromised production
      environments.
    - The AWS Lambda function that is created by this resource has access to both the certificates used to connect to the render queue,
      and the render queue port. An attacker that can find a way to modify and execute this lambda could use it to
      execute any requets against the render queue. You should not grant any additional actors/principals the ability to modify
      or execute this Lambda.

    '''The RenderQueue construct deploys an Elastic Container Service (ECS) service that serves Deadline's REST HTTP API to Deadline Clients.

    Most Deadline clients will connect to a Deadline render farm via the the RenderQueue. The API provides Deadline
    clients access to Deadline's database and repository file-system in a way that is secure, performant, and scalable.

    architecture diagram


    Resources Deployed

    - An Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS) cluster.
    - An AWS EC2 auto-scaling group that provides the instances that host the ECS service.
    - An ECS service with a task definition that deploys the Deadline Remote Connetion Server (RCS) in a container.
    - A Amazon CloudWatch log group for streaming logs from the Deadline RCS.
    - An application load balancer, listener and target group that balance incoming traffic among the RCS containers.



    Security Considerations

    - The instances deployed by this construct download and run scripts from your CDK bootstrap bucket when that instance
      is launched. You must limit write access to your CDK bootstrap bucket to prevent an attacker from modifying the actions
      performed by these scripts. We strongly recommend that you either enable Amazon S3 server access logging on your CDK
      bootstrap bucket, or enable AWS CloudTrail on your account to assist in post-incident analysis of compromised production
      environments.
    - Care must be taken to secure what can connect to the RenderQueue. The RenderQueue does not authenticate API
      requests made against it. You must limit access to the RenderQueue endpoint to only trusted hosts. Those hosts
      should be governed carefully, as malicious software could use the API to remotely execute code across the entire render farm.
    - The RenderQueue can be deployed with network encryption through Transport Layer Security (TLS) or without it. Unencrypted
      network communications can be eavesdropped upon or modified in transit. We strongly recommend deploying the RenderQueue
      with TLS enabled in production environments and it is configured to be on by default.

Not every filesystem's driver supports integration with cachefilesd. e.g. NFS and Amazon EFS do support it, and require the 'fsc' mount option be provided. Note2: Your ECS container host will require access to port 80 on the regional S3 service when enabling this option so that it can install cachefilesd. This host is based on Amazon Linux 2, and the package repository for these systems is hosted on S3 and reached via port 80. Default: false

        :param traffic_encryption: Whether or not network traffic to the RenderQueue should be encrypted. Enabling this requires that all Deadline clients connect with TLS. Default: traffic is encrypted between Clients and the Render Queue and between its components

    Security Considerations

    - The instances deployed by this construct download and run scripts from your CDK bootstrap bucket when that instance
      is launched. You must limit write access to your CDK bootstrap bucket to prevent an attacker from modifying the actions
      performed by these scripts. We strongly recommend that you either enable Amazon S3 server access logging on your CDK
      bootstrap bucket, or enable AWS CloudTrail on your account to assist in post-incident analysis of compromised production
      environments.
    - The file system that is created by, or provided to, this construct contains the data for Deadline's Repository file
      system. This file system contains information about your submitted jobs, and the plugin scripts that are run by the
      Deadline applications in your render farm. An actor that can modify the contents of this file system can cause your
      Deadline applications to run code of their choosing. You should restrict access to this file system to only those who
      require it.
    - The database that is created by, or provided to, this construct is used by Deadline to store data about its configuration,
      submitted jobs, machine information and status, and so on. An actor with access to this database can read any information
      that is entered into Deadline, and modify the bevavior of your render farm. You should restrict access to this database
      to only those who require it.
    - If no file-system is provided to the Repository, then the Repository creates an EFS access point with unrestricted
      access to the entire EFS file-system. If you would like a single EFS file-system that is used by the Deadline
      Repository and other agents, you should supply the file-system and a access-restricted EFS access point to the
      Repository construct instead.

This filesystem will contain files for the Deadline Repository filesystem. It will also contain 40GB of additional padding files (see RFDK's PadEfsStorage for details) to increase the baseline throughput of the filesystem; these files will be added to the /RFDK_PaddingFiles directory in the filesystem. Default: An Encrypted EFS File System and Access Point will be created.

    architecture diagram


    Resources Deployed

    - An Instance Role, corresponding IAM Policy and an Instance Profile.
    - A Fleet Role and corresponding IAM Policy.
    - An Amazon CloudWatch log group that contains the Deadline Worker, Deadline Launcher, and instance-startup logs for the instances
      in the fleet.
    - A security Group if security groups are not provided.
    - An EC2 Launch Template for the Spot Fleet.



    Security Considerations

    - The instances deployed by this construct download and run scripts from your CDK bootstrap bucket when that instance
      is launched. You must limit write access to your CDK bootstrap bucket to prevent an attacker from modifying the actions
      performed by these scripts. We strongly recommend that you either enable Amazon S3 server access logging on your CDK
      bootstrap bucket, or enable AWS CloudTrail on your account to assist in post-incident analysis of compromised production
      environments.
    - The data that is stored on your Worker's local EBS volume can include temporary working files from the applications
      that are rendering your jobs and tasks. That data can be sensitive or privileged, so we recommend that you encrypt
      the data volumes of these instances using either the provided option or by using an encrypted AMI as your source.
    - The software on the AMI that is being used by this construct may pose a security risk. We recommend that you adopt a
      patching strategy to keep this software current with the latest security patches. Please see
      https://docs.aws.amazon.com/rfdk/latest/guide/patching-software.html for more information.

    This provides container images as required by RFDK's Deadline constructs such as

    - {@link @aws-rfdk/deadline#RenderQueue}
    - {@link @aws-rfdk/deadline#UsageBasedLicensing}

    Successful usage of the published Deadline container images with this class requires:

    1. Explicit acceptance of the terms of the AWS Thinkbox End User License Agreement, under which Deadline is
       distributed; and
    2. The lambda on which the custom resource looks up the Thinkbox container images is able to make HTTPS
       requests to the official AWS Thinbox download site: https://downloads.thinkboxsoftware.com



    Resources Deployed

    - A Lambda function containing a script to look up the AWS Thinkbox container image registry



    Security Considerations

    - CDK deploys the code for this lambda as an S3 object in the CDK bootstrap bucket. You must limit write access to
      your CDK bootstrap bucket to prevent an attacker from modifying the actions performed by these scripts. We strongly
      recommend that you either enable Amazon S3 server access logging on your CDK bootstrap bucket, or enable AWS
      CloudTrail on your account to assist in post-incident analysis of compromised production environments.

    For example, to construct a RenderQueue using the images::

       # Example automatically generated from non-compiling source. May contain errors.
       import { App, Stack, Vpc } from '@aws-rfdk/core';
       import { AwsThinkboxEulaAcceptance, RenderQueue, Repository, ThinkboxDockerImages, VersionQuery } from '@aws-rfdk/deadline';

    Internally this is implemented as one or more instances of the Deadline License Forwarder application set up
    to communicate to the render queue and Thinkbox’s licensing system, and to allow ingress connections
    from the worker nodes so that they can acquire licenses as needed.

    The Deadline License Forwarder is set up to run within an AWS ECS task.

    Access to the running License Forwarder is gated by a security group that, by default, only allows ingress from the
    Render Queue (in order to register Workers for license forwarding).

    When a Deadline Worker requires access to licensing via ``UsageBasedLicensing.grantPortAccess(...)``, then the RFDK
    constructs will grant that worker’s security group ingress on TCP port 17004 as well as other ports as required by
    the specific licenses being used.

    Note: This construct does not currently implement the Deadline License Forwarder's Web Forwarding functionality.
    This construct is not usable in any China region.

    architecture diagram


    Resources Deployed

    - The Auto Scaling Group (ASG) added to the Amazon Elastic Container Service cluster that is hosting the Deadline
      License Forwarder for UBL. This creates one C5 Large instance by default.
    - Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS) device(s) associated with the EC2 instance(s) in the ASG. The default volume size is 30 GiB.
    - An Amazon CloudWatch log group that contains the logs from the Deadline License Forwarder application.



    Security Considerations

    - The instances deployed by this construct download and run scripts from your CDK bootstrap bucket when that instance
      is launched. You must limit write access to your CDK bootstrap bucket to prevent an attacker from modifying the actions
      performed by these scripts. We strongly recommend that you either enable Amazon S3 server access logging on your CDK
      bootstrap bucket, or enable AWS CloudTrail on your account to assist in post-incident analysis of compromised production
      environments.
    - The Deadline License Forwarder is designed to be secured by restricting network access to it. For security, only the Deadline
      Workers that require access to Usage-based Licenses should be granted network access to the instances deployed by this construct.
      Futhermore, you should restrict that access to only the product(s) that those workers require when deploying this construct.

    architecture diagram


    Resources Deployed

    - An EC2 Auto Scaling Group to maintain the number of instances.
    - An Instance Role and corresponding IAM Policy.
    - An Amazon CloudWatch log group that contains the Deadline Worker, Deadline Launcher, and instance-startup logs for the instances
      in the fleet.



    Security Considerations

    - The instances deployed by this construct download and run scripts from your CDK bootstrap bucket when that instance
      is launched. You must limit write access to your CDK bootstrap bucket to prevent an attacker from modifying the actions
      performed by these scripts. We strongly recommend that you either enable Amazon S3 server access logging on your CDK
      bootstrap bucket, or enable AWS CloudTrail on your account to assist in post-incident analysis of compromised production
      environments.
    - The data that is stored on your Worker's local EBS volume can include temporary working files from the applications
      that are rendering your jobs and tasks. That data can be sensitive or privileged, so we recommend that you encrypt
      the data volumes of these instances using either the provided option or by using an encrypted AMI as your source.
    - The software on the AMI that is being used by this construct may pose a security risk. We recommend that you adopt a
      patching strategy to keep this software current with the latest security patches. Please see
      https://docs.aws.amazon.com/rfdk/latest/guide/patching-software.html for more information.
