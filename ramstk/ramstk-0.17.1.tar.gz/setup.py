Per\nspec item 4, major version 0 is for initial development and anything may\nchange at any time.  That is certainly the case for RAMSTK!  Because RAMSTK\nis a one developer show, there is no active develop branch at the moment.\n This may change after release of 1.0.0.  Until then, tagged releases can be\nused, but the `latest` tag may not work and may not be backwards-compatible.\n While major version is at 0, breaking changes will be reflected in bumps to\nthe minor version number.  That is, version 0.15.0 is not compatible with\nversion 0.14.0.\n\n## 🎨&nbsp; Features\n\nRAMSTK is built on the concept of modules where a module is a collection of\nrelated information and/or analyses pertinent to system development.  The\nmodules currently included in RAMSTK are:\n\n* Revision Module\n  - Usage profile\n* Function Module\n  - Functional decomposition\n  - Hazards analysis\n  - Failure definitions\n* Requirements Module\n  - Stakeholder input prioritization\n  - Requirement development\n  - Analysis of requirement for clarity, completeness, consistency, and verifiability\n* Hardware Module\n  - Reliability allocation\n      - Equal apportionment\n      - AGREE apportionment\n      - ARINC apportionment\n      - Feasibility of Objectives\n  - Hardware reliability predictions using various methods\n      - Similar items analysis\n      - MIL-HDBK-217F parts count\n      - MIL-HDBK-217F parts stress\n  - FMEA/FMECA\n      - RPN\n      - MIL-STD-1629A, Task 102 Criticality Analysis\n  - Physics of failure analysis\n* Validation & Verification Module\n  - Task description\n  - Task acceptance value(s)\n  - Task time\n  - Task cost\n  - Overall validation plan time/cost estimates\n\n## 💾&nbsp; Installing\n\nRAMSTK uses [postgresql](https://www.postgresql.org/) for its database\nengine.  You\'ll need to have a user with read/write access to a postgresql\nserver to use RAMSTK.  Instructions for setting up the postgresql servers and\ncreating users with the appropriate permissions can be found in the project\n[Wiki](https://github.com/ReliaQualAssociates/ramstk/wiki).\n\n### Download and Install\n\nSince RAMSTK is still a version 0 product, it\'s highly recommended that you\ninstall in a virtual environment.  The instructions below presume you will\nbe installing in a virtual environment and system-wide Python packages that\nRAMSTK depends on will be unavailable.  That being the case, you will need\nvarious system development packages available via your operating system\'s\npackage manager to install RAMSTK.\n\nOnce you have installed any missing development file packages using your\noperating system\'s package manager, download the \\<version> of RAMSTK\nsource from GitHub you wish to install.\n\n```shell\n$ wget https://github.com/ReliaQualAssociates/ramstk/archive/v<version>.tar.gz\n$ tar -xf v<version>.tar.gz\n$ cd ramstk-<version>\n```\n\nThe other option for obtaining the RAMSTK source code is to clone the\nrepository.\n\n```shell\n$ git clone https://github.com/ReliaQualAssociates/ramstk.git ramstk.git\n$ cd ramstk.git\n```\n\nCreate and activate a virtual environment however you are acustomed to.\nOne approach is to use pyenv and poetry.  Using pyenv isn\'t necessary\nunless you want to install and use a Python version other than that\nprovided by your operating system.\n\n```shell\n$ pyenv install 3.8.7\n$ poetry env use ~/.pyenv/shims/python3.8\n$ poetry shell\n```\n\nThis will install Python-3.8.7 and tell poetry to use the Python interpreter\nyou just installed.  Finally, poetry will create, if needed, and activate\nthe virtual environment using Python-3.8.7 as the interpreter.\n\nNow that the virtual environment is activated, you can install the\nnecessary RAMSTK dependencies and RAMSTK itself.  Omitting the PREFIX\nvariable will cause RAMSTK to install to /usr/local by default.\n\n```shell\n$ make depends\n$ make PREFIX=$VIRTUAL_ENV install\n```\n\nWhen upgrading RAMSTK, you can simply:\n\n```shell\n$ pip install -U ramstk\n```\n\nThis will only install the latest RAMSTK version from PyPi and will leave\nconfiguration, data, and icon files untouched.  If you cloned the RAMSTK\nrepository, you can also use the Makefile:\n\n```shell\n$ git switch master\n$ git pull\n$ make install.dev\n```\n\n### Development Dependencies\n\nWe use [poetry](https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry) to manage the\ndependencies for developing RAMSTK.  Using the Makefile, install as follows:\n\n```shell\n$ make depends\n```\n\nThis should get all the needed development and runtime requirements installed\nif they\'re not already.\n\n### Running the Tests\n\nTo run the entire test suite for RAMSTK after installing, simply execute:\n\n```shell\n$ make test\n```\n\nTo run the test suite with coverage, execute:\n\n```shell\n$ make coverage\n$ make coverage.report\n```\n\nTo run specific tests or groups of tests, use pytest:\n\n```shell\n$ pytest -m integration tests/modules/test_allocation.py\n$ pytest -m unit tests/analyses/prediction\n```\n\n## 🔨&nbsp; Usage\n\nAfter installing RAMSTK, it can be launched from a terminal emulator:\n\n```\n$ ramstk\n```\n\nThis is a good option if you need to file an issue as the output should be\nincluded in your report.  RAMSTK also installs a *.desktop file and can be\nfound where ever applications in the category Math or Science are listed.\nIf you\'ve installed in a virtual environment or other non-standard location,\nthis *.desktop file may not be found.\n\nSee the User Guide for the latest usage instructions.\n\n## Documentation\n\nDocumentation for RAMSTK is built and included as release assets.  For each\nrelease, you will find a pdf and html implementation of the User Guide.  For\neach minor and major version release, you will also find a pdf and html\nimplementation of the Developer\'s Guide.\n\n## 💬&nbsp; Contributing\n\nPlease read [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/ReliaQualAssociates/ramstk/tree/develop/docs/CONTRIBUTING.md) for details on our code of conduct, and the process for submitting pull requests to us.\n\nAlso read [DEVELOPMENT_ENV.md](https://github.com/ReliaQualAssociates/ramstk/tree/develop/docs/DEVELOPMENT_ENV.md) for instructions on setting up a development environment to work on and test RAMSTK.\n\n## 🍞&nbsp; Authors\n\n* **Doyle \'weibullguy\' Rowland** - *Initial work* - [weibullguy](https://github.com/weibullguy)\n\n## 📜&nbsp; License\nThis project is licensed under the BSD-3-Clause License - see the [LICENSE](https://github.com/ReliaQualAssociates/ramstk/blob/develop/LICENSE) file for details.\n\nRAMSTK is also registered with the United States Copyright Office under\nregistration number TXu 1-896-035 because I have an attorney and attorneys\nlike to file paperwork for $300/hour.\n\n## Similar Products\n\nThe following are commercially available products that perform RAMS\nanalyses.
