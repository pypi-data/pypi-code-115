    """
    BPMN 2.0 makes a distinction between an embedded subprocess and a call activity.
    From a conceptual point of view, both will call a subprocess when process execution arrives at the activity.

    The difference is that the call activity references a process that is external to the process definition, whereas
    the subprocess is embedded within the original process definition. The main use case for the call activity is to
    have a reusable process definition that can be called from multiple other process definitions.

    When process execution arrives at the call activity, a new process instance is created, which is used to execute the
    subprocess, potentially creating parallel child executions as within a regular process. The main process instance
    waits until the subprocess is completely ended, and continues the original process afterwards.
