Also like a makefile some of these commands are composites. For example, `poetry run task lint` is really just a meta task that runs `poetry run task lint_flake8` followed by `poetry run task lint_mypy`. If you need to see which tasks can be run and what they do, you can use the following command:\n\n```shell\npoetry run task --list\n```\n\nChangelog and semantic version are automated using [Semantic-Release](https://python-semantic-release.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) during the CD process. To accomplish this, this repository makes heavy use of [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/), thought this isn't strictly enforced on the server side at this time until 1.0 is released, but the githooks will lint your commits.\n\n### Start a local MongoDB\n\n```shell\ndocker run -d -p 27017:27017 --name mongo -e MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_USERNAME=username -e MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_PASSWORD=password mongo\n```\n\nOnce the mongodb server is up and running you can create a pymongo client and pass it either into a MongoDBBroker or a MongoDBBackend to test the code locally. Otherwise everything should behave in accordance with the documentation for [Dramatiq](https://dramatiq.io/).\n",
