        1st phase of programming. Loading a programming file.
        Although uds has been standardized, the programming sequences have not and basically every EOM has
        their own flavor. Since ODX based formats have emerged, namely PDX, a programming ODX format,
        a programming file provides

        * binary data: the actual binaries to be programmed
        * means of communication with the target device: typically CAN IDs for an ISOTP channel
        * device compatibility checks based on what identification the device provides,
          e.g. a part number is provided by read data by id
        * device unlock and signature methods, e.g. used crypto functions and keys
        * meta data for each binary data:

          * where the binary goes, e.g. address or index of a binary block and
            subsequently if the location has to be erased in case of flash memory
          * precalculated hashes and signatures for binary blocks
          * binary data may be encrypted or compressed and the programming
             application must know this to populate the corresponding uds services

        This abstracted programmer must obtain all necessary information from the programming file.

        * Identification Check (Application / Optional)
          In case the programming file provides information or identification patterns on the target device,
          this should be checked against the connected device.
        * Preconditions Check (Application)
          An ECU must perform some task, so it must be asked if it is safe to purge regular operation,
          reboot and stay in bootloader without starting application.
        * Preparations Step (Application)
          Any necessary preparation, e.g. disable the settings of DTCs and stop all unnecessary communication.
          This is not actually plausible because when a programming session is started, the scope of operation
          of the ecu typically is very small, so it would not do anything other than handle diagnostic requests.

          time, i.e. like you tell your neighbors that your on holiday for the weekend, so they don't miss you
          and hopefully water your plants.

          The most obvious step last but not least, the start of the programming session, which typically involves
          a reboot to bootloader, and setting some flags before, so bootloader waits for programming instead
