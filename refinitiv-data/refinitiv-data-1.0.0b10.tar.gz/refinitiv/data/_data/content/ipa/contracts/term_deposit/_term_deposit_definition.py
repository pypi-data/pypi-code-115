    Parameters
    ----------
    instrument_tag : str, optional

        characters are supported.
    instrument_code : str, optional
        Code to define the term deposit instrument. For the moment, only RICs for CDs

    start_date : str, optional
        The date the term deposit starts accruing interest. Its effective date.
        By default it is derived from the ValuationDate and the day to spot convention

        The maturity date of the term deposit contract. Either the endDate or the tenor
        must be provided.
    tenor : str, optional
        The period code that represents the time between the start date and end date of
        the contract.
        Mandatory if instrumentCode is null. Either the endDate or the tenor must be
        provided.
    notional_ccy : str, optional
        The ISO code of the notional currency.
        Should be explicitly specified if InstrumentCode hasn't been specified.
        May be retrieved from reference data.
    notional_amount : float, optional
        The notional amount of the term deposit at the start date.
        By default 1,000,000 is used.
    fixed_rate_percent : float, optional
        Fixed interest rate percent to be applied for notional by deal terms.
        Mandatory if instrument_code is None.
    payment_business_day_convention : BusinessDayConvention, optional
        The method to adjust dates to a working day.
        By default 'ModifiedFollowing'.
    payment_roll_convention : DateRollingConvention, optional
        Method to adjust payment dates when they fall at the end of the month.
        By default 'Last'.
    year_basis : DayCountBasis, optional
        The Day Count Basis method used to calculate the interest payments.
        By default 'Dcb_Actual_365'.
    calendar : str, optional
        Calendar used to adjust deposit duration calculation.
        By default the calendar corresponding to notional currency is used.
