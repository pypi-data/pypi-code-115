    ----------
    instrument_tag : str, optional

        - Same (For setting the calculated date to the same day . In this latter case,
          the date may be moved according to the date moving convention if it is a
          non-working day),
        - Last28 (For setting the calculated date to the last working day. 28FEB being
          always considered as the last working day),

        The reset frequency in case the leg Type is Float. Optional. By default the
        IndexTenor is used.
    index_reset_type : IndexResetType, optional
        A flag that indicates if the floating rate index is reset before the coupon
