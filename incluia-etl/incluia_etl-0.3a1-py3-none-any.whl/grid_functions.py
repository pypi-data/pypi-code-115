    Generates a mosaic around a point using batches. A batch is a large mosaic previously stored in S3.
    ----------
    Parameters
        x : float. Longitude of the point of interest.
        y : float. Latitude of the point of interest.
        size: int. Number of pixels of square's side output.
        batch_dict: dictionary of matrices. Initially, in the jupyter-notebook, batch_dict is initialized as
        batch_dict={}. Then on each mosaic_around_point iteration, the dictionary, which is sent back as an output,
        adds if necessary the batches that were necessary for producing the mosaic from that iteration. Since the whole
        city imagery is to memory expensive, the dictionary stores only a number of batches that the machine can store
        in RAM. Therefore, to generate mosaics fast, it is highly recommended that when using it iteratively for a list
        of coordinates, the coordinates are ordered.
        album: geopandas dataframe. Country album.
        lon_difference: float. Longitude difference between two album images centroids.
        lat_difference: float. Latitude difference between two album images centroids.
        y_batch_dim: Number of images within a batch in y-axis.
