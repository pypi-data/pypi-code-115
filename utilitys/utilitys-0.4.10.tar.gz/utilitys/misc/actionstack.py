Inspired by 'undo' on pypi (https://bitbucket.org/aquavitae/undo/src/default/)
but there are many flaws and the project is not under active development. It is
also less pythonic than it could be, using functions where properties are more
appropriate.

  """
  When registering undoable actions of a class with an action stack, it is impossible to use the reference stack's
  decorator since the stack isn't constructed yet. Moreover, creating a class-level default stack and registering all
  actions to it will force all instances of that class to share the same undo buffer. this deferred undoable solves the
  problem. It will record which functions the user wants to register as undoable, and the initialization procedure of
  ActionStackMixin will complete this registration as instances are created. That way, instances of the same class
  have the option of sharing undo buffers, but aren't forced to do so.

  This has the same effect as registering undoable actions in the __init__ body, e.g.:

  ```python
    def __init__(self, ...):
      self.func1 = self.actionStack.undoable('descr')(func1)

      self.func2 = self.actionStack.undoable()(func2)

      # ...
  ```

  Note that deferred action stacks colocate generator functions with their "undoable" registration to avoid confusion,
  promote reuse, etc.
