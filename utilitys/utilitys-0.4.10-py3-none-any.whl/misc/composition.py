  Python has great built-in support for subclassing. However, another common use case is composition-based inheritence,
  which involves a has-a relationship rather than an is-a relationship. Curently, this involves for-looping over the
  attributes from a compositional object to assign them to self, and even this may fail if these attributes aren't
  callable, i.e. if the reference can go stale. This is a helper mixin which allows compositional code to be easily
  written without for-looping over attributes or providing stale references.
