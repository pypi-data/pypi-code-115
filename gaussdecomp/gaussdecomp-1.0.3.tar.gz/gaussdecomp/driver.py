    """
    This program runs the gaussian fitting program 
    on a large part of the HI all sky survey 
     
    This program can be run in three different modes. 
    backret: The program is allowed to go backwards, but MUST return to 
             the position it came from.  This seems to be the best mode 
             to run the program in for most purposes. 
             This is now the DEFAULT mode. 
    noback: The program is not allowed to go backwards.  It will always 
             move in a forward direction until it is finished.  Therefore 
             there is essentially no re-decomposition of positions. 
             To use this mode set noback=True on the command line. 
    wander: The program is allowed to go backwards and forwards (Haud's 
             original algorithm).  If it goes back in y and only 
             the forward x position has been visited before then 
             it will need to go through all x positions before 
             returning to where it came from.  So either use strips 
             narrow in x or run this only once an initial solution 
             for every position has been found. 
             To use this mode set wander=True on the command line. 
     
    If you input gstruc and btrack from a previous run, then the program 
    will start where it left off.  This is useful when you ran it with 
    backret and then want to use the wander mode.  But currently it 
    start where it left off, so if you want it to start at the very 
    beginning again you need to do something (such as adding btrack(0) 
    to the end of btrack: btrack = [btrack,btrack(0)]. 
    This can also be used for debugging purposes. 
     
    Parameters

      Track the progression visually 
    noplot : boolean, optional
      Don't plot anything.  Default is True.
    silent : boolean, optional
      Don't print anything 
    noback : boolean, optional
      The program is not allowed to go backwards.  Default is False.
    backret : boolean, optional
       Any backwards motion must return to the position it 
         came from.  Default is True.
    wander : boolean, optional
       Allow backwards motion. Haud's algorithm.  Default is False.
    gstruc : list, optional
       List of gaussians to start with.
