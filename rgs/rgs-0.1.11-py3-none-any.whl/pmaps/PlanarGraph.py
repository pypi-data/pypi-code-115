'''
Created on Jan 13, 2020

This is a class for the graph object embedded in a plane. 

The graph is a simple graph - no double edges or loops.
It is a rooted graph, so one of the vertices is chosen as a root. By default it is
vertex 0. 
It is desirable that the root is on the outer boundary, and in all cases when we have outer leafs,
it the root should be an outer leaf. This should helps with resetting the root. 
However, the resetting is not yet implemented.
