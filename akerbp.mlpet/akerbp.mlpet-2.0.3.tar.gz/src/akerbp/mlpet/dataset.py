    The main class representing a dataset

    Note:
        **All settings on the first level of the settings dictionary/YAML passed
        to the class instance are set as class attributes**

    Warning:
        **ALL** filepaths (regardless of whether it is directlty passed to the
        class at instantiation or in the settings.yaml file) **MUST** be specified
        in absolute form!

    Note: The id_column is always considered a categorical variable!

    Args:
        mappings: dict or path to a yaml file. If a path is provided it must
            be provided as an absolute path
        settings: dict or path to a yaml file. If a path is provided it must
            be provided as an absolute path. The possible keys for the settings:

                - id_column (required): name of the id column, eg. well_name
                - depth_column (optional): name of the measured depth column, e.g. "DEPTH"
                - label_column (optional): name of the column containing the labels
                - num_filler (optional - default 0): filler value for numerical curves(existing or wishing value for replacing missing values)
                - cat_filler (optional - default 'MISSING'): filler value categorical curves(existing or wishing value for replacing missing values)
                - categorical_curves (optional - default [id_column]): The curves to be considered as categorical when identifying which column as numerical
                    (this setting is used several places throughout the library and can be nice to have defined in advance)
                - keep_columns (optional - default []): If you would like to keep some of the columns passed in your dataframe that will not be part
                    of the preprocessing_pipeline you define but should still make part of the preprocessed dataframe, this setting enables that.
                - preprocessing_pipeline (optional - default None): The list of preprocessing functions to be run when the classes' preprocess function is called.
                    If this is not provided, the pipeline **MUST** be provided in the preprocess call. Each key in the preprocessing_pipeline can have the relevant
                    kwargs for that particular preprocessor as it's value. All passed kwargs are parsed and saved to the class instance where relevant for use as
                    defaults in the preprocessing functions

        folder_path: The path to where preprocessing artifacts are stored/shall
            be saved to. Similar to the other two arguments this path must be
            provided as an absolute path.
