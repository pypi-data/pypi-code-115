    :cite:`Ramette:16`".

    Parameters
    ----------
    N_samples : int
        Size of map to be computed over the radius of the test mass
    HR_port : :class:`finesse.components.Port`
        Port of mirror which the HR surface is on
    static_surface_offset: callable(x,y)
        A 2D function of x and y which returns a static surface
        profile of the mirror. To be used for non-spherial
        polishes or other such effects.
    P_coat_abs : [str|model.components.Variable]
        Name of :class:`finesse.components.Variable` element in the model
        that states how much power is absorbed in the coating
    P_RH : [str|model.components.Variable]
        Name of :class:`finesse.components.Variable` element in the model
        that states how much power ring heater power is applied.
    include_Rc : bool, optional
        If True the RoC of the targetted mirror will be included into
        the maps displacement and the :class:`finesse.knm.maps.Map` is
        flagged as a "focusing element". This can be required if the
        surface distortions from the map add large focusing terms to
        the map. Setting to True can reduce the number of modes needed
        to model the system.

    Returns
    -------
    map : :class:`finesse.knm.maps.Map`
        Map with a functional displacement controlled via the two
        Variables provided. Spot sizes are deduced at runtime from
        the current beam tracing in the model.

    Notes
    -----
    The calculated map uses analytics from both [1] and [2]. Although
    an explicit calculation for the thermo-elastic deformation from the
    ring heater is not presented in [2] it can be well approximated with

    .. math::

        Z(r) = \\alpha \\int T(r, z) \\mathrm{d}z.

    This was compared with finite element modelling and for the LIGO test
    mass and ring heater at least very close.

    .. rubric:: Aperture

    The aperture of the mirror is 0.17m but includes the flat sides
    of the LIGO test masses at 0.163m. Beause of this the aperture
    is set to 0.163m assuming that the optic is not coated beyond this.

    .. rubric:: Variables

    The way to interact with this map is by setting the value of the
    two Variable elements given. No error will be raised if the wrong
    names are given when the map is created. The Variables are only queried
    when the simulation is run or the map is calculated. If the name is
    incorrect a ModelAttrException will be raised.
