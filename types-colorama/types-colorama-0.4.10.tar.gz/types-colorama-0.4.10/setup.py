## Typing stubs for colorama

This is a PEP 561 type stub package for the `colorama` package.

that uses `colorama`. The source for this package can be found at
https://github.com/python/typeshed/tree/master/stubs/colorama. All fixes for
types and metadata should be contributed there.

See https://github.com/python/typeshed/blob/master/README.md for more details.
